Directory: dev
--------------
This directory serves as a parallel to the device directory in the SPICE3
distribution.  The 5 subdirectories correspond to the 5 device classes in
CIDER:
  numd:  2-terminal 1-dimensional
  nbjt:  3-terminal 1-dimensional, special base contact
  numd2: 2-terminal 1-dimensional
  nbjt2: 2-terminal 1-dimensional
  numos: 2-terminal 1-dimensional

  The directory names have been retained for historical reasons and correspond
to the names used in CODECS, the predecessor of CIDER.  However, except for
the 1d BJT class, the device classes can support more than one device type.
For example, the 2-terminal elements, although primarily intended for diodes,
can also be be used to simulate resistors.  A new device type can be defined
by doing the following:
  1. Add it to the list of device types in the input/options.c file,
     if it is not already there.
  2. Add a macro constant name for the device, e.g. OPTN_IGBT
     in include/optndefs.h.
  3. Modify the appropriate ???load.c file in one of the subdirectories
     to provide the correct initial junction voltages and voltage-limiting
     scheme. (See numdload.c for a good example of the use of device type.)
  4. Modify the ???temp.c file to properly account for the polarity of the
     device.
  5. Add any new junction voltage limiting routines to support/limit.c.
  6. Add a case in support/devprint.c to print out the junction voltages
     with intelligible names.
Most of these steps are simply bookkeeping.  The hardest part is defining
an acceptable voltage-limiting scheme.  Beware that no one has attempted
to follow this outline in trying to add a new device.  If there are errors,
please correct this file so that others won't have to duplicate your effort.

  The filenames in the subdirectories have been shortened to comply with
the requirements of MSDOS filenames.  However, CIDER has not yet been compiled
for MSDOS, and so this is mostly a future compatibility issue.
