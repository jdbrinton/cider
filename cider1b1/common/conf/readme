The files in this directory are appropriately modified files taken from
the SPICE3 configuration directory.  While SPICE3 has been compiled on these
systems, CIDER has only been tested using the mips, sun4, and rs6000 
configurations.  Earlier versions have also been tested using the ipsc script.
CIDER may have problems with ANSI-compliant C compilers (incorrect/missing
prototypes for example).  However the basic code is fairly portable, primarily
due to the portability of the SPICE3 core.  The biggest portability headache
is the use of the IEEE finite() function call to trap floating point overflows.
Therefore unless your machine uses IEEE arithmetic, you may have difficulty
porting the code.
