CIDER

9
     CIDER is a mixed-level  circuit  and  device  simulator
that  provides  a  direct link between technology parameters
and circuit performance.  A mixed-level circuit  and  device
simulator  can  provide  greater  simulation accuracy than a
stand-alone  circuit  or  device  simulator  by  numerically
modeling  the critical devices in a circuit.  Compact models
can be used for noncritical devices.


     CIDER couples the latest  version  of  SPICE3  (version
3F.2) to an internal C-based device simulator, DSIM.  SPICE3
provides circuit analyses, compact models for  semiconductor
devices,  and  an interactive user interface.  DSIM provides
accurate, one- and two-dimensional numerical  device  models
based  on  the solution of Poisson's equation, and the elec-
tron and hole  current-continuity  equations.   DSIM  incor-
porates  many of the same basic physical models found in the
the Stanford two-dimensional device simulator PISCES.  Input
to CIDER consists of a SPICE-like description of the circuit
and its compact models, and PISCES-like descriptions of  the
structures  of  numerically  modeled  devices.  As a result,
CIDER should seem familiar to designers  already  accustomed
to  these  two  tools.   For  example, SPICE3F.2 input files
should  run  without   modification,   producing   identical
results.


     CIDER is based on the mixed-level  circuit  and  device
simulator  CODECS,  and  is  a replacement for this program.
The basic algorithms of the two programs are the same.  Some
of  the  differences  between CIDER and CODECS are described
below.  The CIDER input format has greater  flexibility  and
allows  increased  access to physical model parameters.  New
physical models have  been  added  to  allow  simulation  of
state-of-the-art  devices.   These  include transverse field
mobility degradation important in scaled-down MOSFETs and  a
polysilicon  model  for  poly-emitter  bipolar  transistors.
Temperature dependence has been included over the range from
-50C  to 150C.  The numerical models can be used to simulate
all the basic types of semiconductor devices: resistors, MOS
capacitors, diodes, BJTs, JFETs and MOSFETs.  BJTs and JFETs
can be modeled with or without a substrate contact.  Support
has been added for the management of device internal states.
Post-processing of device states can be performed using  the
NUTMEG user interface of SPICE3.  Previously computed states
can be loaded into the program to provide  accurate  initial
guesses  for  subsequent  analyses.  Finally, numerous small
bugs have been discovered and fixed,  and  the  program  has
been ported to a wider variety of computing platforms.

     Berkeley tradition calls for the naming of new versions
of  programs  by affixing a (number, letter, number) triplet
to the end of the program name.  Under  this  scheme,  CIDER
should  instead be named CODECS2A.1.  However, tradition has
been broken in this  case  because  major  incompatibilities
exist  between  the two programs and because it was observed
that the acronym CODECS is already used in the analog design
community to refer to coder-decoder circuits.


9Hardware/Operating System Requirements: The program has been
run  successfully  under: (Ultrix 4, RISC), (SunOS 4, Sun4),
(AIX 3, RS/6000), (UNIX SVR3, iPSC/860 node).  Compatibility
with  other  computer systems has not been tested.  However,
the program is expected to compile  on  most  machines  with
UNIX,  a  C compiler and IEEE-754 floating point arithmetic.
At least 8MB physical memory is recommended.
