TITLE: cider
TEXT: CIDER is a mixed-level circuit and device simulator.
TEXT: CIDER attempts to provide greater simulation accuracy than a stand-alone
TEXT: circuit or device simulator can provide.
TEXT: CIDER is based on the sequential mixed-level circuit and
TEXT: device simulator, CODECS.  In common with CODECS, CIDER embeds the circuit
TEXT: simulator, SPICE3, which provides circuit simulation capabilities,
TEXT: analytical models for semiconductor devices, and an interactive
TEXT: user interface.  An interface to the captive device simulator, DSIM,
TEXT: provides accurate, one- and two-dimensional numerical models
TEXT: based on the solution of Poisson's equation, and the electron and hole
TEXT: current-continuity equations.  The input format of CIDER couples
TEXT: SPICE-like circuit descriptions
TEXT: to a device description format similar to the one
TEXT: used by the PISCES device simulator developed at Stanford University.
TEXT: As a result, CIDER should seem reasonably familiar to designers
TEXT: already accustomed to both these tools.
TEXT: On-line help for CIDER is not currently implemented.
TEXT: For more extensive information on the use of CIDER,
TEXT: consult the User's Manual.
